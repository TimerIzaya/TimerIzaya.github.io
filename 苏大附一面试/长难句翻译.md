​    Opera is expensive: that much is inevitable. But expensive things are not inevitably the province of the rich unless we abdicate society’s power of choice. We can choose to make opera, and other expensive forms of culture, accessible to those who cannot individually pay for it. The question is: why should we? Nobody denies the imperatives of food, shelter, defense, health and education. But even in a prehistoric cave, mankind stretched out a hand not just to eat, drink or fight, but also to draw. The impulse towards culture, the desire to express and explore the world through imagination and representation is fundamental. In Europe, this desire has found fulfillment in the masterpieces of our music, art, literature and theatre. These master-pieces are the touchstones for all our efforts; they are the touchstones for the possibilities to which human thought and imagination may aspire; they carry the most profound messages that can be sent from one human to another.



My advisor, who was an Asian American, had a strong addiction to smoking and drinking, and an irritable temper as well. However, he appreciated the industry and the solid basic knowledge of students with Asian origins. He also had a particularly keen insight into the mentality of these students. So it was not surprising that all the students in his lab were from Asian except one from Germany. The advisor was so straight-forward as to paste an eye-catching notice on the door of his lab, which read: “It is a must that all the research assistants in the lab work from 10 to 12 pm every day, and seven days a week. Furthermore, they should spare no effort in working hours. ” The advisor was well-known for his strictness and severity throughout the university. During the three and a half years of my work there, fourteen students were recruited into his lab, but only five stayed until after they had graduated with a PH.D degree.



Increased cooperation with China is in the interests of the United States.
